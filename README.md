# Basketball Team Win / Loss Prediction Model

RULES OF KAGGLE COMPETITION: 

This project asks you to predict the winning team based on data studiously collected by a basketball fan and a former analyst for the Dodgers. The team names and leagues have been disguised, and the dates removed so that you are forced to use the data, and not your knowledge of the outcomes, for the prediction. The response variable indicates whether, for a given game, the hometeam wins. Roughly 1600 games have been set aside, and you have been given "testing data" that you use to predict whether or not the hometeam wins in each game.  You are given three files. The first, train.csv, contains the variables described below as well as the outcome variable (HTWins). There are 218 variables and 9520 rows. The second, test.csv, contains all of the variables except the outcome variable. IT has 1648 rows. The third is a sample submission that indicates the format for your submission. Note that the ID numbers in your submission file must match the ID numbers in the test file.

For my model, I decided to try a CART initially then a PCR.
